            <h2>Placement Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The placement cell at our university is dedicated to helping students secure job opportunities with top recruiters across various industries. Through industry collaborations, career fairs, and skill-building workshops, students are equipped with the knowledge and resources needed to excel in their careers. Each year, numerous students are successfully placed with competitive packages that highlight the university's strong industry ties and commitment to excellence.
                Our placement process begins early in a studentâ€™s academic journey.
                 The university conducts pre-placement workshops that cover essential skills, including resume building, interview preparation, and communication skills. We also have strong industry collaborations, where companies from sectors like technology, finance, engineering, consulting, and more visit the campus to recruit talented students.
                In addition to this, internships are encouraged as they offer students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in their chosen fields. Internships not only allow students to apply their academic knowledge in real-world scenarios, but they also help students build professional networks and improve their chances of securing full-time positions after graduation.

These activities expose students to the working environment of industries, 
                help them understand the practical implementation of theoretical knowledge, and enhance their professional skills.
                Industrial visits provide students with the opportunity to visit factories, research labs, or corporate offices to witness firsthand the operations, technologies, and processes that drive various industries.
                 <br>

             Professional practice refers to the application of skills and knowledge in a real-world, professional setting, typically through internships or projects. 
                    For students, professional practice offers an essential foundation for their careers and is often a requirement before graduation.</p>
